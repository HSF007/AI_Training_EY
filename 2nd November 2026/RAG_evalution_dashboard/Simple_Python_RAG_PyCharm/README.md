# Simple Python RAG — PyCharm Workshop

A deliberately small, **fully Python-driven** RAG project with a fictional employee-guide document. **No LangChain, Docker, FastAPI, server, or external vector database.**

| Script | What to observe | What is happening |
|---|---|---|
| `01_read_document.py` | Text loaded from Documents | Python opens a local `.txt` document |
| `02_tokenization.py` | Tokens, token IDs, token count | Text is divided into tokens for inspection |
| `03_embeddings.py` | Vector length and sample values; similarity scores | A **local** embedding model converts strings into vectors |
| `04_chunking.py` | Overlapping chunks | Split the full document into **180-token chunks**, with 35-token overlap |
| `05_store_in_chroma.py` | Record count and file path | Embed each chunk; store IDs, vectors, and original text inside project-local ChromaDB |
| `06_search_chroma.py` | Top 3 source chunks and distances | Embed question and retrieve nearest stored vectors. **No AI model call** |
| `07_ask_ai.py` | Retrieved IDs and grounded answer | Send the matching chunk texts + question to OpenAI's Responses API |


### What runs where?

- The source `.txt` file: local in `Documents/`.
- Token inspection: `tiktoken` locally.
- Text embeddings: Chroma's local `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (384 dimensions). Chroma first downloads and caches model files; afterwards vectorization runs locally.
- Chroma database: local and persistent in `chroma_db/`.
- Question search: local vector search.
- Final generative answer: OpenAI API over the internet. **Only the retrieved context and user question are sent to the AI**, not the entire original document.
- OpenAI API usage may incur charges; it is separate from ChatGPT subscriptions.

`tiktoken`'s `cl100k_base` tokenization is educational and used for chunking; the MiniLM embedding model uses its own tokenizer internally. These tokenizations need not be identical.

## Try these questions

1. How many days of annual leave do full-time employees receive?
2. Which days are designated office days for eligible hybrid employees?
3. How quickly should a lost company laptop be reported?
4. What is the reimbursement submission deadline?
5. When must new employees complete security training?
6. What are the initial IT response targets for Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents?
7. What are the maternity leave benefits? (Not specified — should NOT invent an answer.)

## Re-index or replace the document

Edit `Documents/BrightPath_Employee_Guide.txt` and re-run `05_store_in_chroma.py` before searching. The script replaces the prior collection so old chunks do not linger. In this beginner demo, the document must remain a plain text `.txt` file.

## Troubleshooting

- `ModuleNotFoundError`: check PyCharm is using the interpreter where `pip install -r requirements.txt` ran.
- First embeddings are slow: the local MiniLM model is downloading. Run again after it finishes.
- `No indexed collection`: run `05_store_in_chroma.py` before search/AI.
- API key error: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set a real `OPENAI_API_KEY` before step 7.
- `429` / insufficient quota: the OpenAI API account needs billing/credits. You can still demonstrate steps 1–6 for free locally.
- For PDF or DOCX inputs, additional parsing libraries would be needed; this version intentionally uses `.txt` so the RAG stages remain visible.
